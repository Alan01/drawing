          translations.
        </p>

          A few features have been added to the tools: the color picker picks
          the alpha channel too, the ellipses are now geometrically correct, the
          text can be outlined with the secondary color, and the corners of the
          rectangles can be rounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's now impossible to accidentally delete the selection while editing
          it with the 'scale' or the 'crop' tool.
        </p>
        <p>Tabs can be closed with a middle-click.</p>
        <p>
          What replaces the transparent channel when saving as JPEG or BMP is
          now an option the user can change in the preferences window.
