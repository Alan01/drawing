  <releases>
    <release version="0.8.4" date="2021-11-06">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 0.8.4 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
          translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Undoing several operations one after another should be less slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not possible anymore to reload the picture from the disk if it
          has never been saved on the disk to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text tool gains an option to disable anti-aliasing.
        </p>

    <release version="0.8.3" date="2021-07-18">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 0.8.3 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
          translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          After rotating the selection, it had an incorrectly big height, but
          now it's fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outline of the free selection is now visible even when the image
          is very zoomed out.
        </p>
      </description>

    <release version="0.8.2" date="2021-06-26">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 0.8.2 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
          translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boundaries of the canvas are now always visibly delimited, to
          better render the area where you can draw, even if the canvas is
          transparent. It also helps to see what parts of the selection may
          disappear when you will unselect it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transform tools can now draw a preview of the pixels they may create
          outside of the current canvas, which makes the 'crop', 'scale', and
          'rotate' tools more intuitive to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The straight line tool has a new option to lock its angle, so you can
          draw perfect horizontal, vertical, or 45° strokes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The `--edit-clipboard` command line option now works with Wayland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scaling an image using the numerical inputs now preserves the original
          proportions of the image (unless the "never keep proportions" option
          is enabled).
        </p>
        <p>
          This version of the app is compatible with older GNOME versions
          (Ubuntu LTS 18.04).
        </p>

    <release version="0.8.1" date="2021-06-12">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 0.8.1 features several minor bug fixes, and various new
          translations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can now crop or expand the canvas to a size based on the current
          selection size, using new actions available in the selection menus.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bug, where the "crop" tool could erase the image under certain
          conditions, has been fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the preferences window, there is now an option to select if you
          prefer the dark theme variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several options have been added, to the "calligraphic nib" brush, the
          "eraser" tool, and the "pencil".
        </p>
      </description>
    </release>

    <release version="0.8.0" date="2021-04-24">
      <description>
        <p>
          With Drawing 0.8.0, you can finally use a tablet and a stylus to draw
          with pressure-sensitive tools, such as the new 'brush' and 'airbrush'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fullscreen mode has been completely redesigned to provide an
          easier yet less intrusive access to the tools and their options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filters have been rewritten to be more reliable, and a new filter to
          harmoniously increase contrast has been added.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you move or delete the selection, now the pixels left behind can
          optionally be a specific color, rather than always transparency.
          This specific color can be excluded from the selection. That feature
          is complex to explain with words, try it yourself you'll see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Options such as the text background type and the shape filling style
          are now persisted when closing the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user interface for selecting the active color application mode has
          been rewritten to better show the accurate label, and better organize
          the possible modes as submenus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "blur" mode has been removed, which simplified the situation and
          allowed several tools ("shapes" and "brushes") to get support for the
          color application modes in general.
