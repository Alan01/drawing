    <release version="0.6.0" date="2020-09-20">
      <description>
        <p>
          Version 0.6 is a major update, with various important changes. The app
          is more robust and has more tools:
        </p>
        <p>
          Rectangle selection and freehand selection are now distinct tools, and
          the 'rotate' tool now supports any angle and handles horizontal or
          vertical flipping.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numerous tools producing shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon, …),
          have been merged into a single, more consistent 'shape' tool, along
          with 'rounded rectangle' and 'ellipse'. Their filling options now
          include various types of gradients.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text tool can now write using most system fonts, thus allowing
          more complex characters to be used (e.g. Asian characters).
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'saturate' tool has been replaced by 'filters', a more powerful
          tool with several types of blur, color inversion, pixelization,
          saturation and transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fullscreen mode is now available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most prominent new feature is the ability to zoom in (or out) on
          the image, using the minimap, the touchpad or the mouse wheel.
