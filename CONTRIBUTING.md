# Bug reports

- If you can, try to **check if the bug has already been fixed but not released**.
- Report it with informations required by the adequate issue template.
- If it's meaningful, try to include screenshots.

----

# Feature requests

- If you can, try to **check if the feature has already been added but not released**.
- Report it with informations required by the adequate issue template.
- In the report, explain **what** it does, **not how** it does it.

----

# Translating

Notice that this procedure will translate the unstable, unreleased version
currently developed on the `master` branch. If you want to entirely translate
older versions, restart this procedure but run `git checkout 0.4` just after
having cloned the repo, and at the end, open the merge request to `0.4` too.

### Get the .po file

- Fork the repo and clone your fork on your disk (see [installation instructions here](#with-gnome-builder-and-flatpak))
- **If the translation exists but is incomplete:**
	- Find the file corresponding to your language in the the `po` directory.
- **If the translation doesn't exist at all:**
	- Add your language to `po/LINGUAS`
	- Run `msginit -i po/drawing.pot --locale=xx -o po/xx.po`, where `xx` should
	be replaced by the ISO code of your language. This command will produce a
	`.po` file for your language in the `po` directory.

### Translate

Use a text editor or [an adequate app](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Gtranslator)
to translate the strings of this `.po` file.

Concerning the "original version" in english: i'm **not** a native english
speaker, so there might be mistakes. If you find incorrect english labels,
please report an issue about them.

##### Comments

There are comments in the file to give context helping you to translate some
strings, please take them into account.

Example of something translators can't guess so it's written in the comments:
since this app is a clone of MS Paint, `Paint;` (untranslated) has to be in the
list of keywords for finding the app in searchable menus or software centers.

##### Accelerators

When words have an underscore in them, it defines a keyboard accelerator working
with the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key: for example, if an english-speaking user uses a
layout with a menu-bar, pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> will open the
`_File` menu.

In translations, the underscore can be on another character of the word, but
translators should take into account that 2 labels activatable at the same time
can't share the same accelerator.

Example: `Édi_tion` and `Ou_tils` can't work, but `É_dition` and `Ou_tils` can
work.

Also, the character should be accessible easily from the keyboard layouts of
your language.

### Submitting your translation

- **(optional)** If you want to test your translation:
	- The flatpak SDK isn't able to run a translated version of the app, so
	export it as a `.flatpak` file and install it with `flatpak install path/to/that/file`.
	- Or (it's harder) [install it with `meson`](#with-git-and-meson).
- Run `git add po && git commit && git push`
- Submit a "pull request"/"merge request"

# Contribute to the code

### General guidelines

- It's better if an issue is reported first
- Easy issues are tagged "[good first issue](https://github.com/maoschanz/drawing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)"
- Tell on the issue that you'll try to fix it

**If you find anything weird in the code, or don't understand it, feel free to
ask me about it.**

To set up a development environment, see [here](#install-from-source-code).

### Syntax and comments

- Use 2 spaces in `.ui` or `.xml` files.
- Good comments explain *why* the code does what it does. If a comment explains
*what* it does, the comment is useless, or the code is bad. (useless comments
are fine, don't worry)
- Upon translatable strings, comments explaining the context to translators are
welcome.

**In python code only:**

- Use actual tabs (4 columns wide).
- Try to not write lines longer than 80 characters.
- Use double quotes for strings the user might see, and single quotes otherwise
(paths, constants, enumerations, dict keys, …)

### Structure of the code

The `data` directory contains data useful for installation but useless to the
execution (app icons, desktop launcher, settings schemas, appdata, …).

According to some people, this directory should contain the UI resources, but
here no: resources used by the app (`.ui` files, in-app icons, …) are in `src`,
along with the python code.

>See [here](./diagrams/) for explanations about the architecture and class
diagrams (**WORK IN PROGRESS**)

### UI design

If you want to change something to the user interface:

##### About Glade

People sometimes like to design their apps in Glade, or in the "GUI designer"
extension integrated in GNOME Builder.

But in Drawing, the UI is modular, and the `.ui` files are mere templates filled
algorithmically according to the user's actions and settings. So you have to:

- edit them with a text editor, since the point of a given file is hard to
understand by just looking at the Glade preview;
- run the app to be sure of how your changes to these files actually look like
once filled with the accurate widgets.

If you **ever** even try to use Glade or a similar software, the auto-generated
code will re-order all the lines, and add dozens of useless properties. Such a
commit diff would be unreadable, so a merge request with this kind of change
would be rejected.

Glade also removes all comments, which are essential to the generation of the
translation files. It also removes some of the empty containers meant to be
filled by the python code, thus breaking the app. Please do not use Glade here.

##### Design guidelines

Try to respect [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/)
as much as possible, while making your feature available from the menubar
(in `app-menus.ui`). The menubar is hidden in most cases, but it should contains
as many `GAction`s as possible for testing purposes (and also because searchable
menus still exist).

If you're contributing to an alternative layout ("elementary OS", "Cinnamon", or
any other), please be sure to not hurt the UX with the GNOME layout (since it's
the one used on smartphone, be careful it has to stay very resizable).

### Other remarks

I like `GAction`s and i've added wrapper methods for using them, try to use that
instead of directly connecting buttons/menu-items to a method.

In my opinion, the difficulties with the code can come mainly from 3 points:

- tools are window-wide, while the operations they produce, which are stored in
the history, are image-wide.
- the interactions with the selection are ridiculously complex and numerous
_(defining, explicit applying, explicit canceling, import, clipboard methods,
use by the "canvas tools" (cancelled or confirmed), deletion, implicit applying,
implicit canceling, …)_ which can easily create small bugs.
- the horizontal and vertical scrollings (and their scrollbars) are managed
"manually" and quite poorly.

These 3 points sometimes can lead to object-oriented spaghetti code.

If you change anything regarding the selection and/or the "canvas tools" (the
tools which can edit the selection content), make sure to test various scenarios
like this one:

1. several images edited in different tabs of the same window;
2. zoom and/or scroll;
3. select things, or import/paste things (in both tabs);
4. edit the selection (in both tabs, don't forget to click "apply" before
switching to the other tab);
5. unselect it (in both tabs);
6. undo/redo.

# Install from source code

You will not get updates with this installation method so please do that only
for contributing to development, translations, testing, or packaging.

### With GNOME Builder and flatpak

This app is developed using _GNOME Builder_ and its support for `flatpak`:

- Open _GNOME Builder_
- Click on "Clone a repository…" and use this address: `https://github.com/maoschanz/drawing.git`
- Open it as a project with GNOME Builder
- Be sure the runtime is installed (if it doesn't suggest it automatically,
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> → type `update-dependencies`)
- Click on the _Run_ button

### With `git` and `meson`

See [here](#dependencies) for the list of dependencies.

Get the code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maoschanz/drawing.git
```

Build the app:
```sh
cd drawing
meson _build
ninja -C _build
```

Install the app (system-wide):
```sh
sudo ninja -C _build install
```
(if you know the options to install user-wide, please tell)

The app can then be removed with:
```sh
cd _build
sudo ninja uninstall
```

### Others

<details><summary>With flatpak-builder (not recommended, that's just for me)</summary>
<p>

Initial setup of the local flatpak repository:
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maoschanz/drawing/master/com.github.maoschanz.drawing.json
flatpak-builder --force-clean _build2/ --repo=_repo com.github.maoschanz.drawing.json
flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify local-drawing-repo _repo
flatpak --user install local-drawing-repo com.github.maoschanz.drawing
```

Update:
```sh
flatpak-builder --force-clean _build2/ --repo=_repo com.github.maoschanz.drawing.json
flatpak update
```

</p>
</details>

You can also build a debian package with the script `deb_package.sh`, but you
won't get updates that way, so don't do that. You probably don't have all the
dependencies to make the script work anyway.

----

# Packaging

### Branches

The `master` branch is not stable and **should not** be packaged.

<details><summary>(except if your distro have experimental repos)</summary>
<p>

<a href=https://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental>How to set up the debian
experimental repository</a>

```sh
sudo apt -t experimental install drawing
```

</p>
</details>

Stable versions for end-users are **tagged**, and listed in this Github repo's
"_Releases_" section. For now, most of them are on the `0.4` branch.

### Dependencies

Dependencies to run the app:

- GObject Introspection (GI) for python3 (on Debian, it's `python3-gi`). A
version ≥3.30.0 is required to run the code from the branch `master`. The branch
`0.4` should be fine with any version.
- `cairo` library's GI for python3 (on Debian, it's `python3-gi-cairo`).
- GTK libraries' GI (on Debian, it's `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`).

Dependencies to build the app (Debian packages names):

- `meson`. The version of meson required by the `meson.build` file at the root
of the project can be changed if necessary, but please don't add this change to
your commit(s).
- `appstream-util` (validation of the `.appdata.xml` file)
- `libglib2.0-dev-bin` (IIRC that one is to compress the `.ui` files and the
icons into a `.gresource` file)
