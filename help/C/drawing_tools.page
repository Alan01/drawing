  <title>Classic tools</title>

  <p>Various tools are available, most of them use the selected color: drawing
  with a left click uses the left color, while drawing with a right click uses
  the right color. The tool size and options are also important, and are
  available in the bottom bar.</p>

      chosen color.</p>
      <p>Its options include the shape of the lead, the use of dashes, and the
      edition mode: the "classic" mode applies the color of the pencil on top of
      the image's pixels, the "source color" mode replaces the pixels by the
      selected color, and the "eraser" mode delete existing colors.</p>
